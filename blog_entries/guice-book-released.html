Guice Book Released!
March 28, 2008
I should really get some sleep, but I can't wait to get the word out. The book I was working on "<a href="https://www.apress.com/gb/book/9781590599976">Google Guice: Agile Lightweight Dependency Injection Framework</a>" has gone live! It's available in ebook and print-on-demand formats.<br/>    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="/img/book_small.thumbnail.png" alt="Guice Book" height="128" hspace="15" vspace="15" width="102" /></div><br/>Apart from the title, I think the book reflects the fact that I'm a no-nonsense guy. I'm just like you, interested in new technology and I want to see this Guice thing in action. They did <i>that</i> with dependency injection? Hell yes; let's see why they did it, and who they killed to get there (just kidding :-)).<br/><br/>So, months later I look on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Google-Guice-Lightweight-Dependency-Firstpress/dp/1590599977">Amazon</a>, and see this:<br/><br/><img src="/img/better_together.png" align="middle" border="0" height="113" width="594" /><br/><br/>You can get my humble work together with the best Java book ever. That alone was so worth it :-)<br/><br/>Thanks again to <a href="https://www.apress.com">Apress</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/crazybob">Bob</a>, <a href="http://www.wideplay.com">Dhanji</a> and the Guice community: I couldn't have done it without you.
