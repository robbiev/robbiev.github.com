-Guice Book Released!
March 28, 2008
I should really get some sleep, but I can't wait to get the word out. The book I was working on "[Google Guice: Agile Lightweight Dependency Injection Framework](https://www.apress.com/gb/book/9781590599976)" has gone live! It's available in ebook and print-on-demand formats.

Apart from the title, I think the book reflects the fact that I'm a no-nonsense guy. I'm just like you, interested in new technology and I want to see this Guice thing in action. They did *that* with dependency injection? Hell yes; let's see why they did it, and who they killed to get there (just kidding :-)).

So, months later I look on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Google-Guice-Lightweight-Dependency-Firstpress/dp/1590599977), and see this:

You can get my humble work together with the best Java book ever. That alone was so worth it :-)

Thanks again to [Apress](https://www.apress.com), [Bob](https://twitter.com/crazybob), [Dhanji](http://www.wideplay.com) and the Guice community: I couldn't have done it without you.
