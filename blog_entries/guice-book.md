-Guice Book
December 12, 2007
I'm writing [a book](http://www.amazon.com/Google-Guice-Lightweight-Dependency-Injection/dp/1590599977/) on [Google Guice](https://github.com/google/guice), the notorious DI framework created by [Bob Lee](https://twitter.com/crazybob). I've been active in the Guice community for quite a while now, and I have to say that it's an honor to get the opportunity to write about one of the most innovative Java frameworks out there. Now that it's been published on Amazon, I feel like I've reached the point of no return. The world knows, so I'd damn well better make sure that I deliver some quality. So far I'm having a blast, so perhaps I'm still in [Ted's phase two](http://blogs.tedneward.com/post/quotes-on-writing/). :-)

On a related note, I enjoyed talking to Bob at [Javapolis](https://web.archive.org/web/20071109054921/http://www.javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP07/Home) today. [On popular demand](https://web.archive.org/web/20100612200431/http://crazybob.org/2007/12/guice-javapolis.html) he took the advanced route for his [Guice talk](https://web.archive.org/web/20081121065312/http://www.javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP07/Guice), which I think was appropriate. Too bad he didn't have enough time to go through the example though. I was pleased to learn that much of what he talked about already made it into the book, in some form. Which must be a good thing, right? Anyway, one more day at Javapolis, and then back to work. :-)

Wish me luck. I'll try to make sure I won't need it. ;-)
