Guice, Spring 2.5 and Finding Mistakes Early
March 15, 2008
Yesterday I gave a talk on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/">Guice</a> at the <a href="http://java.profict.nl">Profict Wintercamp</a>! The goal of the event was to look at how Guice changes the <a href="http://www.springframework.org">Spring</a> landscape by letting both sides present their framework. From the Guice side there was me (thanks <a href="http://crazybob.org">Bob</a>, for not being able to come! ;-)), from the Spring side there was <a href="http://blog.arendsen.net/">Alef Arendsen</a>.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, there was only one Guice user present! They should have given us an "I went to the Profict Wintercamp and I lived." t-shirt. :-) No seriously, I had a great time and enjoyed talking to other developers and the guys from SpringSource. Let's hope I convinced some people to take a look at Guice!<br/><br/>Right before the talk I had some time to spare, so I quickly threw together a Guice demo application that I then re-implemented using the Spring 2.5 new annotation-driven configuration options. Next, I decided to take a look at how Spring compares with Guice in terms of error detection and error handling. This has always been one of Guice's strengths, but it's also one of those "nice-to-haves". It's like a cell phone. You don't miss it until you have one. All those Spring users don't know what they are missing!<br/><br/>The example code can be found <a href="http://code.google.com/p/garbagecollected/wiki/GuicySpring">here</a>, and the error handling comparison can be found <a href="http://code.google.com/p/garbagecollected/wiki/SpringAndGuiceErrors">here</a>. I'll upload the presentation and the packaged source code soon. Enjoy!
