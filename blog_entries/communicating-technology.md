-Communicating Technology
November 23, 2007
More than a year ago I watched [this](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=31871) Channel 9 interview in which [Don Box](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Box) shares some tips on how to give a great technical presentation. I often catch myself using his advice in areas beyond tech talks. I'm not sure if these are all from that interview, but here's a list of things that I find useful.

 - **The Goal**: probably a universal truth, but if I'm working on something that will be heard or read by other people, it's surprising to see how quick I lose track of the initial goal of the work. Do sanity checks. Will this serve the goal?
 - **The Font**: code needs to be readable. I'd say the right code font is [Consolas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolas) on Windows, or [Monaco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco_%28typeface%29) on the Mac. For God's sake, don't use Courier New. The font is the first thing I configure in a fresh IDE install.
 -  **The Size**: use the smallest possible example to explain a concept. Have slides with only a few words on them. Say more with less. It's amazing how good that works.
 - **The Puzzle**: give the audience something to look for. A hidden joke. A mistake on the slides.
 - **The Humor**: nobody is *that* serious
 - **The Story**: people like stories. They don't have to be true.
