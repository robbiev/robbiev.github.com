        More than a year ago I watched <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=31871" title="Don Box&#39;s tech talk advice" target="_blank">this</a> Channel 9 interview in which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Box">Don Box</a> shares some tips on how to give a great technical presentation. I often catch myself using his advice in areas beyond tech talks. I&#39;m not sure if these are all from that interview, but here&#39;s a list of things that I find useful.<br/><ul><br/>	<li><strong> The Goal</strong>: probably a universal truth, but if I&#39;m working on something that will be heard or read by other people, it&#39;s surprising to see how quick I lose track of the initial goal of the work. Do sanity checks. Will this serve the goal?</li><br/>	<li><strong>The Font</strong>: code needs to be readable. I&#39;d say the right code font is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolas">Consolas</a> on Windows, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco_%28typeface%29" title="Monaco" target="_blank">Monaco</a> on the Mac. For God&#39;s sake, don&#39;t use Courier New. The font is the first thing I configure in a fresh IDE install.</li><br/>	<li> <strong>The Size</strong>: use the smallest possible example to explain a concept. Have slides with only a few words on them. Say more with less. It&#39;s amazing how good that works.</li><br/>	<li><strong>The Puzzle</strong>: give the audience something to look for. A hidden joke. A mistake on the slides.</li><br/>	<li><strong>The Humor</strong>: nobody is <em>that</em> serious</li><br/>	<li><strong>The Story</strong>: people like stories. They don&#39;t have to be true.</li><br/></ul><br/>Go <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071109054921/http://www.javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP07/Home" target="_blank">Javapolis</a>! :-)
