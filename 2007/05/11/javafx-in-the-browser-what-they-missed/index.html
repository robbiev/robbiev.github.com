        <p><strong>1. Applets have a bad name</strong></p>
<p>Is it really hard to imagine this: you&#39;re at the water cooler, and one of your colleagues asks you what you&#39;re up to. You admit it: you&#39;re implementing Java Applets. So the other guy just stares at you for a second and starts laughing, guessing it was a joke!</p>
<p>What I&#39;m trying to illustrate here, is that Sun should have waited until they had the &#34;consumer JRE&#34;, and should have launched a new Applet initiative at the same time that new JRE launched. Call it AppletFX, drop the name, whatever... just get that bad taste out of people&#39;s mouths. Which brings me to my second point.</p>
<p><strong>2. They announced it too early</strong></p>
<p>Sun probably felt the Adobe and Microsoft pressure in the same market, so the announced their thing ASAP. Guess what, they had nothing impressive to show. Sure, there&#39;s JavaFX Script. Sure you can draw circles and make buttons spin. Hell no, you can&#39;t use your mouse wheel in JavaFXPad (what gives?). I mean, where&#39;s the candy? The impressive story? The leading vision? The cool feature? The great performance? As they say, you only have one chance to make a good first impression.</p>
<p><strong>3. They forgot to include rich video an sound support.</strong></p>
<p>People come for the bling, but stay for the platform. If you haven&#39;t got the bling, nobody is there to stay. I didn&#39;t hear them announcing anything on the subject. Did I miss that part?</p>
<p><strong>4. Scripting is harder to read compared to XML (for designers?)</strong></p>
<p>Say what you want about XML formats, but people got used to reading XML. Not a lot of syntax to look at, and easily toolable.</p>
<p>Sun is looking at yet another missed opportunity to revive in-browser Java apps. But they <em>do</em> have a nice alternative for creating desktop UI&#39;s now.</p>
