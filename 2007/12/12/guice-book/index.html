        <div class="entry">

        I&#39;m writing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Google-Guice-Lightweight-Dependency-Injection/dp/1590599977/">a book</a> on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/">Google Guice</a>, the notorious DI framework created by <a href="http://crazybob.org">Bob Lee</a>. I&#39;ve been active in the Guice community for quite a while now, and I have to say that it&#39;s an honor to get the opportunity to write about one of the most innovative Java frameworks out there. Now that it&#39;s been published on Amazon, I feel like I&#39;ve reached the point of no return. The world knows, so I&#39;d damn well better make sure that I deliver some quality. So far I&#39;m having a blast, so perhaps I&#39;m still in <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2007/12/08/Quotes+On+Writing.aspx">Ted&#39;s phase two</a>. :-)<br/><p align="left"><a href="http://garbagecollected.wordpress.com/2007/12/13/guice-book/guice/" rel="attachment wp-att-23" title="Guice"></a></p><br/><p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://garbagecollected.wordpress.com/2007/12/13/guice-book/guice/" rel="attachment wp-att-23" title="Guice"><img src="/img/guice.jpg" alt="Guice"/></a></p><br/>On a related note, I enjoyed talking to Bob at <a href="http://www.javapolis.com">Javapolis</a> today. <a href="http://crazybob.org/2007/12/guice-javapolis.html">On popular demand</a> he took the advanced route for his <a href="http://www.javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP07/Guice">Guice talk</a>, which I think was appropriate. Too bad he didn&#39;t have enough time to go through the example though. I was pleased to learn that much of what he talked about already made it into the book, in some form. Which must be a good thing, right? Anyway, one more day at Javapolis, and then back to work. :-)<br/><br/>Wish me luck. I&#39;ll try to make sure I won&#39;t need it. ;-)
