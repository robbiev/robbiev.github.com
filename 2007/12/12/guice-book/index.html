        <div class="entry">I'm writing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Google-Guice-Lightweight-Dependency-Injection/dp/1590599977/">a book</a> on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/">Google Guice</a>, the notorious DI framework created by <a href="http://crazybob.org">Bob Lee</a>. I've been active in the Guice community for quite a while now, and I have to say that it's an honor to get the opportunity to write about one of the most innovative Java frameworks out there. Now that it's been published on Amazon, I feel like I've reached the point of no return. The world knows, so I'd damn well better make sure that I deliver some quality. So far I'm having a blast, so perhaps I'm still in <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2007/12/08/Quotes+On+Writing.aspx">Ted's phase two</a>. :-)<br><p align="left"><a href="http://garbagecollected.wordpress.com/2007/12/13/guice-book/guice/" rel="attachment wp-att-23" title="Guice"></a></p><br><p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://garbagecollected.wordpress.com/2007/12/13/guice-book/guice/" rel="attachment wp-att-23" title="Guice"><img src="/img/guice.jpg" alt="Guice"></a></p><br>On a related note, I enjoyed talking to Bob at <a href="http://www.javapolis.com">Javapolis</a> today. <a href="http://crazybob.org/2007/12/guice-javapolis.html">On popular demand</a> he took the advanced route for his <a href="http://www.javapolis.com/confluence/display/JP07/Guice">Guice talk</a>, which I think was appropriate. Too bad he didn't have enough time to go through the example though. I was pleased to learn that much of what he talked about already made it into the book, in some form. Which must be a good thing, right? Anyway, one more day at Javapolis, and then back to work. :-)<br><br>Wish me luck. I'll try to make sure I won't need it. ;-)</div>
