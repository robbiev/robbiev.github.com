        <h1>Non-functional Software</h1>
        <div class="date">May 18, 2016</div>
        <div class="entry"><p>When we plan to build a software system we often discuss two sets of requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_requirement">Functional</a></strong>: <em>&quot;When I do X, the software does Y.&quot;</em>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement">Non-functional</a></strong>: privacy, performance, security, compatibility, ...</li>
</ol>
<p>Recently I found <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/littleidea/architecture-what-does-it-even-mean">another definition for non-functional requirements</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>requirements which, if not met, will make a system non-functional</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, lately I&apos;ve been thinking about this definition and how it relates to software dependencies. <strong>Unless you&apos;re writing an operating system, your software always depends on other software</strong>. At the very least you&apos;ll be making some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call">system calls</a> into the operating system. Using threads, sockets, files? These <strong>operating system dependencies are a part of your non-functional requirements</strong>.</p>
<p>What I&apos;m getting at is that even if your library does not depend on other libraries (in the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM</a> or <a href="https://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> sense), <em>you still have dependencies</em> that are often implicit to the environment and you should consider documenting them. If your software&apos;s documentation says that <em>&quot;When I do X, it does Y&quot;</em> but it doesn&apos;t say anything about creating 100,000 threads to do Y, then you may want to consider documenting that. <strong>Your non-functional requirement (or lack thereof) is my non-functional behaviour</strong>.</p>
<p>Usually, however, the problem is much more subtle. A pet peeve of mine is that libraries often don&apos;t document <strong>what thread a piece of code will run on</strong>. What&apos;s wrong with you people? If you write a framework or your library accepts a callback function, in other words you control the entry point, then you absolutely need to document this.</p>
<p>Similarly, when is something blocking and when is it non-blocking? Is it okay to be blocked for long? If not, what do I do instead? If it accesses a networked service, does it automatically reconnect? With back-off? These are all things I need to know to ensure luck is not a factor in successfully running your software.</p>
<p>We should have a name for this kind of software - <strong>non-functional software</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>software that, by not documenting its non-functional behaviour, is non-functional</p>
