        <p>A while ago a saw <a href="http://antirez.com/news/43">this interesting post</a> on reliability of software (in this case Redis). The author says:

</p><blockquote>
  Software reliability is an incredibly complex mix of ingredients.<br/>
  <ol>
    <li>Precision of the specification or documentation itself. If you don&#39;t know how the software is supposed to behave, you have things that may be bugs or features. It depends on the point of view.</li>
    <li>Amount of things not working accordingly to the specification, or causing a software crash. Let&#39;s call these just software &#34;errors&#34;.</li>
    <li>Percentage of errors that happen to be in the subset of the software that is actually used and stressed by most users.</li>
    <li>Probability that the conditions needed for a given error to happen are met.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

You can also think of this as a definition of quality. Quality is just something that people perceive. Your users perceive it based on their expectations,  the analyst perceives it based on their specification and you as a programmer perceive it based on your software. This is worth capturing for future reference, so I decided to create the following diagram. What is quality?<p></p>
