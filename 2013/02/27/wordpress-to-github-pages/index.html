        <p>
For years my blog has been hosted on <a href="http://garbagecollected.wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a>. As you have probably guessed from this blog entry&#39;s title I chose to host my blog on <a href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> going forward.
</p>
<p>
I had the following goals for my blog migration:
</p><ul>
  <li>Generating WordPress-compatible URLs</li>
  <li>Optionally, having a migration path to a new URL naming scheme</li>
</ul>
The reason I&#39;m even bothering to migrate old blog entries is that I want to be a good internet citizen. I always find it annoying when links break so I&#39;ll try to at least do my part. This means <b>migrating the content and generating URLs that are compatible</b> with WordPress. Luckily I was already using a custom domain name, making it all possible.
<p></p>
<p>
WordPress URLs look like this:
</p><blockquote>http://garbagecollected.org/2008/04/06/dollarmaps/</blockquote>
Targeting GitHub Pages you then have two options:
<ol>
  <li>mkdir -p 2008/04/06; touch 2008/04/06/dollarmaps.html</li>
  <li>mkdir -p 2008/04/06/dollarmaps; touch 2008/04/06/dollarmaps/index.html</li>
</ol>
The first option <em>appears</em> to work at first; GitHub <a href="https://github.com/holman/feedback/issues/231">automatically finds</a> the &#39;.html&#39; file with the correct name and serves its contents. However, the show stopper for me is that this no longer works if you add a trailing slash, something which WordPress always seems to do. So <a href="http://garbagecollected.org/2008/04/06/dollarmaps">http://garbagecollected.org/2008/04/06/dollarmaps</a> works, but <a href="http://garbagecollected.org/2008/04/06/dollarmaps/">http://garbagecollected.org/2008/04/06/dollarmaps/</a> doesn&#39;t. Not acceptable. This means that the only other option is to <b>create directories with an index.html</b>.
<p></p>
<p>
Now what about changing the URL naming scheme? Well, it turns out this is not really possible using GitHub pages. You would normally issue an HTTP redirect, but that&#39;s not supported. So then you can either generate <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10178304/github-jekyll-old-pages-redirection-best-approach">placeholder pages</a> that redirect using JavaScript or the &lt;meta&gt; tag, or create a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10178304/github-jekyll-old-pages-redirection-best-approach">custom 404 page</a> that does the same. These are all more of a hack; you&#39;ll need to start <a href="http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=139394">telling Google</a> that there is really only one page and things like that. For now I decided that new blog entries will follow the WordPress naming scheme until I find an easier hosting solution than GitHub&#39;s Pages.
