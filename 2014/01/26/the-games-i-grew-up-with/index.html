        <h1>The Games I Grew Up With</h1>
        <div class="date">January 26, 2014</div>
        <div class="entry">

        <p>Yesterday I discovered (and watched) <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1942884/">Indie Game</a>, a kickstarter-funded documentary depicting two teams of (now well known) indie game developers and their struggle to get their project out the door.</p>
<p>It amazed me how the games featured in the film (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braid_(video_game)">Braid</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Meat_Boy">Super Meat Boy</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fez_(video_game)">Fez</a>) are a lot like the video games I played when I was a kid. They reminded me of countless hours I spent with the first computer we owned, our trusty 80286 with 1MB of RAM and 20MB of hard disk space, numbers that sound medieval by today&#39;s standards.</p>

<em>Me and my cousin playing Commander Keen</em></p>
<p>Today I spent some time compiling a list of the games I enjoyed most back then, some of which I completely forgot they even existed!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Axe">Golden Axe</a></strong>
An arcade beat &#39;em up classic in which you can ride tiny dinosaurs. Had a lot of fun playing this with my brother (on the same keyboard). Dwarf is best.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_of_the_Jungle">Jill of the Jungle</a></strong>
2D platformer by Epic, now famous for the Unreal series.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_keen">Commander Keen</a></strong>
Breakthrough side-scroller by id Software, who we all know as the developers of the Wolfenstein, Doom and Quake games.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D">Wolfenstein 3D</a></strong>
One of the first popular first-person shooters in a 3D world. Mein leben! I actually never heard the Germans say that - we did not have speakers.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hocus_Pocus_(video_game)">Hocus Pocus</a></strong>
You&#39;re a wizard in this 2D platformer. I remember I loved the graphics and begged my dad to buy the full version for me. Never happened.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Cup_Italia_%2790">World Cup Italia &#39;90</a></strong>
I was unbeatable in this football game.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://pilot51.com/wiki/Lander">Lander (by George Moromisato)</a></strong>
One of the only reasons I started Windows sometimes (this and Tetris). A classic lunar lander game. Someone apparently ported this game to Android.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushover_(video_game)">Pushover</a></strong>
Amazing puzzle game in which you&#39;re an ant placing dominoes. One of the few games my dad loved as well. Found out that someone <a href="http://pushover.sourceforge.net/">reimplemented the game with updated graphics</a>!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Persia_(1989_video_game)">Prince of Persia</a></strong>
The original. I remember having to restart so many times because I didn&#39;t know the controls for swordfighting (it was the insert key I believe - not sure).</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Wolf">Operation Wolf</a></strong>
Arcade shooter. Grenade! Grenade!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Power_(video_game)">Fire Power</a></strong>
You drive a tank and shoot at stuff. I had a lot of fun playing this.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_&#39;Ironman&#39;_Stewart&#39;s_Super_Off_Road">Ironman</a></strong>
Simple but very fun racing game. Like many of the games listed here you can&#39;t save and come back to it later - I remember my mum dragging me away from this for dinner. &#34;BUT I CAN&#39;T SAVE, DON&#39;T YOU UNDERSTAND??&#34;.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_(1989_video_game)">Sim City</a></strong>
The original city building game.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft_Flight_Simulator#Flight_Simulator_3.0">Flight Simulator 3</a></strong>
I never got the point of this game, but it was interesting to learn how to play it without a manual.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Prix_Circuit_(video_game)">Grand Prix Circuit</a></strong>
Formula One racing game. My brother was unbeatable. Made by the same <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinctive_Software">company</a> as the next three games (apparently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Mattrick">the now-CEO of Zynga</a> founded it).</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cycles:_International_Grand_Prix_Racing">The Cycles: International Grand Prix Racing</a></strong>
Looks almost exactly like Grand Prix Circuit, but this one&#39;s with motorbikes.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Drive_(video_game)">Test Drive</a></strong>
Break the law and get chased by the police.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Duel:_Test_Drive_II">Test Drive II</a></strong>
Get chased by the police with slightly better graphics.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blues_Brothers_(video_game)">The Blues Brothers</a></strong>
For the soundtrack.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Nukem_II">Duke Nukem II</a></strong>
Barely ran on our machine. Duke Nukem in 2D!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarian_(Psygnosis)">Barbarian</a></strong>
The character animations were so funny.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supaplex">Supaplex</a></strong>
Puzzle game in which you dig yourself through a digital world and try to not get crushed by falling eggs.</p>
<p>Notably absent are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(video_game)">Doom</a> (required a 386) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)">Quake</a> (486?) because we basically had the same 286 computer until we made the jump to a Pentium 200 with 64MB or RAM and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voodoo2">3Dfx Voodoo 2 video card</a> (running Windows NT). By then I moved on to the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_(video_game)">GTA</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_2">Warcraft II</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_(video_game)">Diablo</a> (though I did play some Quake 1 and 2 on this machine)</p>
<p>As far as console games go, our neighbour had a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System">NES</a> so I played quite a bit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.">Super Mario</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_(1989_video_game)">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a> there. Later I got a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Genesis">Sega Megadrive II</a> and played a lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai_Shodown">Samurai Shodown</a>.</p>
<p>So many good memories. Which were your childhood games?</p>
