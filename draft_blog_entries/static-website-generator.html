<p>The first thing I did was to go to my Wordpress control panel and export my blog as XML. Since I was planning to roll my own static website generator, I then needed to parse that XML and generate something pretty from it. So the I decided to give Node.js a try. I'm using Jake as a <em>make</em> replacement, XML2JS for parsing XML, Moment for date/time stuff and Cheerio which is essentially JQuery for the server. I wanted to give the latter a try for HTML templating after seeing it in <a href="https://gist.github.com/robashton/3969285">one of Rob Ashton's gists</a>.
